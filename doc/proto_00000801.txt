1. DNS protocol
======================================================

----------------------------------------
1.1 Quick alphabetical index / register:
----------------------------------------


	0-9	Data packet
	A-F	Data packet
	I	IP address
	L	Login
	N	Downstream fragsize	(NS.topdomain A-type reply)
	O	Options
	P	Ping
	R	Downstream fragsize probe
	S	Switch upstream codec
	V	Version
	W				(WWW.topdomain A-type reply)
	Y	Downstream codec check
	Z	Upstream codec check

CMC = Cache Miss Counter, increased every time it is used

---------------------------------------
1.2 Unauthenticated packets (pre-login)
---------------------------------------

Upstream codec check / bounce:
Client sends:
	First byte z or Z
	Lots of data that should not be decoded
Server replies:
	The requested domain copied raw, in the lowest-grade downstream codec
	available for the request type.

Downstream codec check:
Client sends:
	First byte y or Y
	rest in base32:
	1 byte codec ID (see 
	4 bytes random CMC
	
	Possibly extra data, depending on check variant
Server sends:
	Data encoded with requested downstream codec; data content depending
	on check variant number.
	BADCODEC if requested downstream codec not available.
	BADLEN if check variant is not available, or problem with extra data.

	Downstream codec chars are same as in 'O' Option request, below.

	Check variants:
	1: Send encoded DOWNCODECCHECK1 string as defined in encoding.h

	(Other variants reserved; possibly variant that sends a decoded-encoded
	copy of Base32-encoded extra data in the request)

-----------------
1.3 Login process
-----------------

Version:
Client sends (length 1+8):
	First byte v or V
	Rest encoded with base32:
	4 bytes big endian protocol version
	4 bytes random CMC
Server replies:
	1 char:
		A (version ok), followed by login challenge
		N (version differs), followed by server protocol version
		F (server has no free slots), followed by max users
	4 byte value: means new userid/server protocol version/max users
	16 byte server login challenge
Note: The CMC value is used as a "seed", so following the version command
all queries must be sent with CMC of ((previous CMC + 1) % MAX_UINT32).
The server response also contains random "downstream" CMC which has the same
requirements, although only applies to downstream traffic.

Login:
Client sends (length 2+37):
	First byte l or L
	1 byte userid char (hex)
	Rest encoded with base32:
	1 byte flags: (least to most significant bits)
		0: connect to remote TCP port (data pipe/ProxyCommand mode)
		1: use non-localhost remote IP
		2: remote IP is IPv6
		3: check forward connected status
		4-8: unused
	16 bytes hash of password + server login challenge
	16 bytes client login challenge
	4 bytes CMC
Server replies:
	BADAUTH if bad login
	4 bytes server IPv4 address (network byte order)
	4 bytes client IPv4 address (network byte order)
	2 bytes MTU (network byte order)
	1 byte netmask bits (like CIDR)
	16 bytes hash of password + client login challenge
If the requested UDP forwarding options are not accepted by the server, the
response is simply LNAK.
Since UDP is connectionless, the server just sends packets to the given IP/port
when data is received from the client, and will forward any packets received from
that same IP/port back to the client.

The login process is outlined as follows:
	1. Successful version check; server provides a 16-byte login challenge to
		the client.
	2. The client performs MD5 hash of (server login challenge XOR MD5 hash of
		password). The client generates a random 16-byte client login challenge
		which is sent with the MD5 hash to the server in a login packet.
	3. The server performs MD5 hash of (server login challenge XOR MD5 hash of
		password) and replies to the login query. From this point onwards,
		all packets are signed with HMAC as described in section "Protocol
		security".

------------------------------------------------
1.4 Authenticated packets (after login complete)
------------------------------------------------

IP Request: (for where to try raw login)
Client sends:
	First byte i or I
	1 byte userid char (hex)
	Rest encoded in base32:
	4 bytes CMC
	12 bytes HMAC
Server replies:
	BADAUTH if bad authentication
	1 byte length of IP address
	Then comes external IP address of iodined server
	as 4 bytes (IPv4) or 16 bytes (IPv6)

Switch upstream codec:
Client sends:
	First byte s or S
	1 byte userid char (hex)
	rest encoded in base32:
	4 bytes CMC
	12 bytes HMAC
	1 byte codec type (see codec types in section "Query and response format")
Server sends:
	BADCODEC if not accepted. Client must then revert to previous codec
	BADLEN if length of query is too short
	BADAUTH if bad auth
	1 byte codec type if accepted (After this all upstream data packets
		must be encoded with the new codec.)

Set Options:
Client sends:
	First byte o or O
	1 byte userid char (hex)
	rest encoded in base32:
    4 bytes CMC
    12 bytes HMAC
	1 byte option flags:
    +76543210+
    |0LKUICCC|
    +--------+
	2 bytes remote UDP port (big endian) - appears only when U-flag is set
	4-16 bytes remote IP address (4 bytes if IPv4 or 16 for IPv6) - included
	 only if flags U and I are set)
Server sends:
	BADCODEC if not accepted. Previous situation remains.
	BADAUTH if bad auth
	1 byte accepted codec type
	
Option flags:
	L: Lazy mode enabled, server will keep a number of requests waiting until
		data becomes available to send downstream or the requests time out.
		The timeout value for requests is controlled by the client.
		Applies only to data transfer; handshake is always answered immediately.
		See section "Lazy mode operation".
	K: Downstream compression enabled (compressed before encoding)
	U: UDP forward enabled
	I: 0=IPv4, 1=IPv6
	CCC: Codec field (see codec types in section "Query and response format")
	If codec unsupported for request type, server will use Base32; note
	that server will answer any mix of request types that a client sends.
	Server may disregard the encoding options; client must always use the
	downstream encoding type indicated in every downstream DNS packet.


Probe downstream fragment size:
Client sends:
	First byte r or R
	1 byte userid char (hex)
	Rest encoded as base32:
	4 bytes CMC
	12 bytes HMAC
	2 bytes fragsize (network byte order)
	Then follows a long random query which contents does not matter.
Server sends:
	BADFRAG if requested length not accepted.
	BADAUTH if bad auth
	2 bytes requested fragsize (network byte order)
	1 byte random "seed"
	Following is (fragsize-16) bytes of data, starting with the random seed,
	and each following byte is incremented with 107.
	This is checked by the client to determine corruption.

Set downstream fragment size:
Client sends:
	First byte n or N
	1 byte userid char (hex)
	Rest encoded with base32:
    4 bytes CMC
    12 bytes HMAC
	2 bytes new downstream fragment size (network byte order)
Server sends:
	BADFRAG if not accepted.
	2 bytes new downstream fragment size. After this all downstream
	payloads will be max (fragsize + 2) bytes long.

--------------------------
1.5 Data packets and pings
--------------------------

Upstream data:
	1 char ASCII hex coded user ID
	rest encoded with chosen upstream codec (default base32):
    4 bytes CMC
    4 bytes HMAC
	1 byte flags:
     76543210
    +--------+
    |00000CFL|
    +--------+
    1 byte packet sequence ID

Downstream data header:
	1 byte sequence ID
	1 byte flags
	                  |=> only if ping (P) flag set       |
    0        1        3        4        5        6        7
    +--------+76543210+--------+--------+--------+--------+
    | Seq ID |0EIPACFL|Dn Wsize|Up Wsize|DnWstart|UpWstart| (+ data...)
    +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

Flags and fields:
	UUUU = Userid
	L = Last fragment flag
	A = ACK flag
	F = First fragment flag
	C = Compression enabled
	P = ping flag: extra header present - downstream only
	I = responded to immediately (for RTT calculation) - downstream only
	Up/Dn Wsize/Wstart = upstream/downstream window size/window start Seq ID 

Downstream data starts with 3 byte header, followed by data, which may be
compressed. If Ping flag is set, another 4 bytes are appended to the header,
containing upstream and downstream window sizes and window start sequence IDs.
The response does not need to contain data. If the server has no data to send,
the response will always include the ping header and the ping flag will be set.

Ping:
Client sends:
	First byte p or P
	1 byte userid char (hex)
    4 bytes CMC
    12 bytes HMAC
	Rest encoded with Base32:
    0.......7 12
    +--------+76543210+
    |WWWWSSDD|000WT00R|
    +--------+--------+
	1 byte window size (upstream)
	1 byte window size (downstream)
	1 byte window start sequence ID (upstream)
	1 byte window start sequence ID (downstream)
	2 bytes server timeout in ms (net. byte order)
	2 bytes downstream fragment ACK timeout in ms (net. byte order)
	1 byte flags:
		W = update window frag timeout
		T = update server timeout
		R = response must contain ping header (data optional)
	4 bytes CMC
	12 bytes HMAC
Server replies with a (possibly empty) data packet with the ping (P) flag set.
	If R (respond) bit is set, the server responds immediately with a data+ping packet.
	The server must also adjust its window sizes to those provided by the client.
	If the T flag is set, the server sets the user's DNS timeout to the value
	specified by the packet.

If the bit corresponding to changing a particular value (ie. window timeout) is
not set, the value should be random. (note: this is disabled in debug mode).

In lazy mode, unless the R flag is set, the server will hold the ping until it
times out or more data becomes available to send.

-----------------------------
1.7 Query and response format
-----------------------------

The DNS answer header is independent from the command, unlike in upstream
packets. It varies based on the DNS response type, but the contents are always
in the same format once decoded.

In NULL and PRIVATE responses, downstream data (anything returned from the
server, not just data packets) is always raw. In all other response types,
downstream data is encoded (see Options above).

Downstream response header is as follows:
	1 char base32-encoded flags:
	 +98765+   H    = 0: HMAC is 96-bit, 1: 32-bit
	 |HECCC|   CCC  = Codec type (0-7)
	 +-----+   E    = 0: no error, 1: Codec field = error code
	Rest encoded with specified codec:
	4 bytes CMC (network byte order) (random for pre-login responses)
	4 or 12 bytes HMAC (note: HMAC field is 32-bits random for all pre-login responses)
	(data follows)

Encoding is determined by value of codec field and response type.
TXT response type:
	End result is always DNS-chopped (series of len-prefixed
	strings <=255 bytes). Data is encoded before chop, decoded after un-chop.
	Raw encoding is possible, however data is still DNS chopped.
SRV/MX/CNAME/A response:
	Data is DNS-hostname encoded as normal which requires "undotify-ing" before
	decoding, and is "dotified" after encoding.
SRV and MX may reply with multiple hostnames, each encoded separately. Each
has a 10-multiple priority, and encoding/decoding is done in strictly
increasing priority sequence 10, 20, 30, etc. without gaps. Note that some DNS
relays will shuffle the answer records in the response.

Codec field values:
	0x0: base32   (a-z0-5)
	0x1: base64   (a-zA-Z0-9+-)
	0x2: base64u  (a-zA-Z0-9_-)
	0x3: base128  (a-zA-Z0-9\274-\375)
	0x4: raw      (\000-\377)
Error codes:
	0x0: BADLEN (packet below minimum length, maybe truncated)
	0x1: BADHMAC (HMAC does not match, packet was rejected)
	0x2: BADUSER (user session has timed out)
	0x3: BADCODEC (codec not accepted by server)
	0x4: BADFRAG (frag len not accepted by server)

Protocol security
=================

With the introduction of protocol 00000801, iodine now requires all packets
sent from both the server and clients after a successful login to include a
32-bit (incremental) replay-protection counter and be signed with a 32- or
96-bit (truncated) HMAC-MD5 digest. This aims to ensure that the packets have
not been modified or corrupted during transmission, and to provide some
protection against replay attacks. Additionally the HMAC makes it possible
to check if packets have been truncated by intermediate DNS servers.

The HMAC component of the authentication is calculated using the HMAC-MD5 algorithm
according to RFC 2104. The key is calculated according to the following process:
	1. Calculate MD5(plaintext password)
	2. Calculate MD5(server challenge)
	3. Calculate MD5(client challenge)
	4. Append result from (2) to result from (1)
	5. Append result from (3) to result from (4) and pad with 0x2C to 64 bytes
	6. Bitwise XOR result from (5) with 0xB5
	7. Calculate the MD5 hash of the result from (6), this is the key for the HMAC.
The HMAC is applied to the raw data (before encoding or after decoding), and to
to ensure that the entire packet (including user char and command) is signed it
is necessary to include the command and userid somehow. Process is as follows:
	1. The packet is prepared (assembled in case of sending, decoded to the point
		where the HMAC field is available in case of receiving).
	2. The HMAC field is set to 0 (since it is included in the data to be signed,
		but at the same time cannot sign itself).
	3. The userid byte is XORed with the first byte of the decoded data.
	4. The command byte (if present) is XORed with the 2nd byte of decoded data.
	5. The HMAC is calculated using the decoded data and decoded data length.
	6. Receiving: the calculated HMAC is compared to the value in the original packet.
		Sending: the calculated HMAC is inserted into the HMAC field, and the raw
		data is encoded as necessary.
It should be noted that the codec used is not signed by the HMAC. This would mean
that if the data was intercepted and reencoded differently in such a way that
iodine was still able to decode it, the HMAC would still be valid.

Since iodine authentication is based on MD5, which can no longer be considered
to be cryptographically secure, it is not possible to claim that the protocol
is resistant to tampering. Furthermore, it is likely that 32-bit HMACs are not
sufficient using any algorithm to guarantee the authenticity of the data.
While the addition of HMAC in protocol 00000801 may provide some level of security,
it does not provide any guarantee that your iodine session can not be hijacked
and is not intended to give peace of mind to the iodine user.

Replay protection existed in previous versions of the protocol in the form of
the CMC (Cache Miss Counter) however this functions primarily to prevent DNS
servers from sending cached replies to iodine queries. This source of packet
replays is limited to some degree by the use of the CMC but since neither the
client or server keeps track of which CMC values have been seen before, so it
remains possible that intermediate DNS servers will repeat queries (with a
valid HMAC) that can disrupt iodine sessions.
Possibly the simplest way to avoid this is to include a 32-bit incremental
CMC in the packet header which can easily be tested to be unique based on
whether or not packets have been seen with higher CMC values. 


"Lazy-mode" operation
=====================

Client-server DNS traffic sequence has been reordered to provide increased
(interactive) performance and greatly reduced latency.

Idea taken from Lucas Nussbaum's slides (24th IFIP International Security
Conference, 2009) at http://www.loria.fr/~lnussbau/tuns.html. Current
implementation is original to iodine, no code or documentation from any other
project was consulted during development.

Server:
In lazy mode, except where otherwise specified, responses are sent using the
oldest pending query held in the server's buffer (QMEM). The server responds
to a stored pending query when the query times out, an upstream ACK is pending
(for that user), or the server has an excess of pending queries (more than the
user's downstream window size).

Upstream data fragments are ACK'd immediately to keep data flowing.

Upstream pings are answered immediately only when the Respond flag is set (see
ping header), in which case the response is to the same DNS query as the ping.
Immediate responses (<10ms old) to either ping or data requests are marked
and used to calculate the round-trip-time for the connection.

Client:
The client keeps track of all queries it sends, and maintains a minimum of
<downstream window size> pending queries to fill the server buffer.
Downstream data is always ACK'd immediately with a new request (either a ping
or data if available). The client sends excess requests (ie. already has enough
pending queries) for ACKs or for new data.


======================================================
2. Raw UDP protocol
======================================================

This protocol is faster since the data is not encoded and transferred
on top of the DNS protocol. Full packets are compressed and sent when they
arrive on the tun device, and are processed immediately on the other side.

All Raw UDP protcol messages start with a fixed-length 20-byte header.
This is not the start of a valid DNS message so it is easy to identify.

Raw UDP Header:
	3 bytes magic:  0x10d19e
	1 byte command (4-bits C) and user id (4-bits U):
		 7654 3210
		+----+----+
		|CCCC|UUUU|
		+----+----+	
	4 bytes CMC/relay protection counter
	12 bytes HMAC

Login message (command = 1):
	This message can only be sent after the full DNS-based login sequence has been
	completed successfully. The client enters raw mode by sending this message,
	which must be signed using the client's 96-bit HMAC. 
	After the login message has been exchanged, both the server and the client
	switch to raw udp mode for the rest of the connection.

Data message (command = 2):
	After the header comes the payload data, which is always compressed.

Ping message (command = 3):
	Sent from client to server and back to keep session open. Has no payload.
